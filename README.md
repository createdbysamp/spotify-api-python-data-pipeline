SPOTIFY API for Artist's Top Tracks


Simply add your client id's to a file called .env
Type in the name of the table at the top (and DB file name)
DB_FILE
TABLE_NAME

Type the name of the artist you're looking for in the main() method, and BOOM!
You get a table with the top hits for that artist.

All their non-explict tracks are returned in order to the terminal output, so you can check that there.
